# **Gurgaon Real Estate Price Prediction**

## **Project Overview**

This project focuses on predicting real estate prices in Gurgaon based on various property features and analyzing key trends in the real estate market. The dataset includes details such as property type, sector, built-up area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, furnishing type, and other relevant factors.

## **Modules**

### **1. Price Prediction**

This module leverages machine learning algorithms to predict property prices based on input features. The goal is to develop an accurate model that helps in estimating the price of real estate properties in Gurgaon.

**Features Used:**

1. Property Type

2. Sector

3. Built-up Area

4. Age/Possession Status

5. Number of Bedrooms & Bathrooms

6. Presence of Study Room, Servant Room, Store Room

7. Number of Balconies

8. Furnishing Type

9. Luxury Category

10. Floor Category

**Target Variable:**

1. price_in_cr (Property price in crores)

**Approach:**

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Feature Engineering
3. Outlier Detection and Removal
4. Feature Selection
5. Model Selection (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.)
6. Hyperparameter Tuning
7. Model Evaluation (using cross-validation)

### 2. Analysis Module

This module focuses on exploring trends in the Gurgaon real estate market using data visualization techniques.

**Key Analysis:**
1. Price Distribution Across Different Sectors
2. Impact of Built-up Area on Property Prices
3. Effect of Furnishing Type and Luxury Category and many more

## **Future Enhancements**

Inclusion of More Features, such as:

1. **Recommendation System** : Suggests optimal properties based on user preferences, market trends, and locality price dynamics.
2. **Insights Module**: To explain how individual features (e.g., built-up area, furnishing type, sector) impact property prices.
3. **Enhanced Machine Learning Models** : Incorporate state-of-the-art algorithms like XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost for superior prediction accuracy.
4. **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Utilizes HyperOptuna to fine-tune models for maximum efficiency.
5. Scrap dataset for more cities like Delhi, Bangalore, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Pune, etc.
